3. Design Descripton:
	The amba_thermometer_nexys_ddr4 core reads data from the ADT7420 temperature sensor on the Nexys 4 DDR board, 
	processes this data in a moving average algorithm and ouputs the temperature on the seven-segment LED display. 
	The components of the core communicate via the AMBA ABP bus.

	For a more detailed description of the functionality of the system and its sub-components, 
	please refer to the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory.

4. Design Characterization for the Nexys 4 DDR board:
	I)   Timing Analysis: Maximum data path delay: t = 5.994 ns.
	II)  Power Analysis: Average power consumption: P = 0.1 W.
	III) Resource Consumption: Percentage of used slices: r = 1.6 %.

## PRE-REQUISITES

Synthetization and implementation of the design and generation of the bitstream is done with Vivado 2018.
(Tested with Vivado v2018.3 64-bit for Windows, on Windows 10)

In order to execute the Makefile and its targets on Windows, it is recommended to:
1. Get git-bash for Windows: https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Add your local Vivado installation directory to the system path variable
3. Add wget and make to your git-bash: https://gist.github.com/evanwill/0207876c3243bbb6863e65ec5dc3f058


## USAGE

For information about the usage of the core, please refer to the documentation in the doc/ sub-directory.

To build targets use the following make commands:
